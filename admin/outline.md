## Policies

### Dates subject to change

The instructor and university reserve the right to modify elements of the course during the term. The university may change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances. If either type of modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. It is the responsibility of the student to check their McMaster email and course websites weekly during the term and to note any changes.

### Missing tests

Illnesses or other personal circumstances must be reported following the procedures laid out by the Associate Dean's Office:  <http://www.science.mcmaster.ca/associatedean/>.  In most cases, missed tests will be addressed by reweighting the remaining tests. If you must miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to find out what was covered. The best way to do this is to borrow a classmate's notes, read them over, and then ask your instructor if there is something that you do not understand.

### Online component

We will be using the learning software Avenue to Learn.  Students should be aware that private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may be visible to other students in the course. By taking this course you consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please discuss them with the course instructor. Grades will be posted on AtL.

### Academic Integrity
You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behavior in all aspects of the learning process.  Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity.  Academic dishonesty can result in serious consequences, including a notation on the transcript, or suspension or expulsion from the university.  It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty; for more information please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy at <http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity>.

Here are four common examples of academic dishonesty:

* *Plagiarism*: For example, the submission of work that is not one's own or for which other credit has been obtained.
* *Improper collaboration*: In this course, you are encouraged to discuss the assigned problems with other students in your class. However, when the work is not explicitly assigned as a group project you must write the solutions in your own words without referring to any other students' work. The copying or even paraphrasing of anyone's solutions will be considered academic dishonesty. For group projects, you will be asked to report your own assessment of how you contributed to the group's work.
 * *Copying or using unauthorized aids in examinations*: In this course you are not allowed to talk to or communicate in any way (e.g. pass notes) with anyone but the instructor or the invigilators during an examination.
 * *Continuing to write once the announcement that the alloted time for a test or examination is over* without the express consent of the instructor or one of the invigilators.

You should check these once they become available and bring any discrepancies to the attention of the instructor or the TA as soon as possible.
